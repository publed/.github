---
‚û°Ô∏è a decentralized knowledge-sharing platform that aims at democratizing & socializing knowledge by incentivizing knowledge production and sharing, ultimately benefiting students, professors, researchers, and society as a whole.


### **Problems We Address**
---
Academia and Science suffers from several problems 
- Access Barriers
- Data Fragmentation
- Opacity Culture
- Lack of Incentivies
- Silos

### **How It Works**
---

1. If you are a researcher, student, professor, or simply someone eager to share knowledge, all you need to do is Upload your knowledge artifacts, including:
  - datasets
  - presentations
  - demo videos
  - code
  - research papers
  - research artifacts, ...

2. All your artifacts will be aggregated into a Knowledge Object (compressed NFT) and published on Publed

3. And you're done! Now your Knowledge Object is ready to be accessed by the community, with interactions, comments, discussions, and more.

### Features

- **Ownership Transparency:** Gain a clear and immutable record of ownership for your contributions, fostering transparency and recognition within the community.
  
- **Incentivized Collaboration:** Actively participate in knowledge sharing, collaboration, and peer engagement to earn rewards and recognition.
