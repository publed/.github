## Publed 
> Democratizing Scientific Publishing

üëã Welcome to the Publed! 

‚û°Ô∏è Join us and take control of your scientific contributions! Monetize, be rewarded! Unlock the potential of your research with our decentralized, transparent, and collaborative platform.

## About Publed

‚û°Ô∏è We aim to democratize scientific publishing by creating a decentralized ecosystem that fosters open access, transparent peer review, and global collaboration. By leveraging _Web3_ technologies like **Blockchain**, **NFTs**, and **Decentralized Storage**, we facilitate access to research, incentivize quality contributions, and empower the scientific community to drive innovation and knowledge dissemination.

## OPOS Hackathon

### **Publed**
---
‚û°Ô∏è a decentralized scientific publishing platform that aims to address the challenges of the traditional and centralized publishing system by empowering researchers, liberating them from traditional gatekeepers, protecting their ownership, and enabling the monetization of their genuine work through crypto-economic incentives.


### **Problems We Address**
---
Traditional Scientific Publishing suffers from several problems 
- Centralized Monopoly
- Silos
- Opacity Culture
- Paywalls
- Obsolete Format

### **How It Works**
---
‚û°Ô∏è Researchers can submit their research artifacts, including papers, videos, demos, code, datasets, and more. Each submission is associated with an NFT that represents the entire Research Object, serving as a proof of IP ownership.

üèõÔ∏è Flexible Models for Researchers:

Researchers enjoy the flexibility of choosing from different models that suit their needs:

1. Free to Publish | Free to Access:

- Researchers can effortlessly submit their objects without undergoing a peer-review process. By opting for this route, they secure the NFT without incurring any charges, and users gain free and unrestricted access to the object.

2. Pay to Publish | Pay to Access:

- For those who desire peer review, choosing this option involves authors paying a low fee to publish the Research Object. Users looking to access the object will also pay, either on a per-use basis or through subscription plans. This fee structure contributes to the distribution of rewards among reviewers and maintains the platform's sustainability.

3. Pay to Publish | Free to Access:

- The author has the autonomy to make the decision that suits them best. If the author wishes to pay for a peer review but wants to make their research object freely accessible to the entire community, they have the freedom to do so.

### Features
---

- **Research Artifact Submission:** Transform your research artifacts into tangible Research Objects (NFTs), preserving their value and ownership on the blockchain.

- **Proof-of-Reviews:** Create an unalterable record of your reviews by minting NFTs for each review you perform, fostering transparency and recognition within the community.

- **Earn as a Reviewer:** Engage in the peer-review process and be rewarded for your valuable contributions to the scholarly community.

- **Earn as an Author:** Gain recognition and rewards by publishing your research objects, empowering you to monetize your genuine efforts and insights.

#### New NFT use cases
> Build new applications pushing the boundaries of NFTs

- We push the boundaries of NFTs by using them in the realm of science, more precisely Scientific Publishing.

We harnessed NFTs to craft Research Objects, encompassing all vital elements of a scientific work (paper, video, demo, slides, code). These NFT-based objects not only establish ownership but also facilitate monetization.

Additionally, we created NFTs to immortalize reviewers' efforts transparently and openly within the community.

Leveraging Crossmint - Minting APIs and EditNFT feature, allows us to create dynamic NFTs that are updated over time, keeping scientific records up to date and allowing us to edit/update the Review status of a research object.

#### Product Demo
> Create a PoC product that helps best showcase what Solana is capable of.


We've developed a PoC Dapp that underscores Solana as the ideal blockchain for revolutionizing the scientific publishing landscape. Solana stands out not just for its remarkable speed and cost-efficiency, but also for its comprehensive array of features and protocols that empower innovation.

From Dynamic NFTs to Compressed NFTs and beyond, Solana's robust infrastructure opens doors to groundbreaking possibilities that seamlessly integrate into the scientific publishing landscape.
